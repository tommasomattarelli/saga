# Changelog

All notable changes to SAGA are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This log is curated by hand — it is not a dump of `git log`. Add entries under
`[Unreleased]` as you work, split into `### Highlights` (user-facing) and
`### Internal`. On release the notes move to
`docs/changelog/CHANGELOG-vX.Y.Z.md` (and the GitHub Release) and
`[Unreleased]` is reset; this root file keeps only `[Unreleased]`.

## [Unreleased]

### Internal

- Reorganized backend evaluation tools and tests, indexed their guide, and clarified harness-independent skills and owner authorization for external evaluation calls.
- Recorded ADR 0020 from the owner-interview plan for batched memory, durable production and save-aware histories, with explicit offline and live-evaluation gates.
